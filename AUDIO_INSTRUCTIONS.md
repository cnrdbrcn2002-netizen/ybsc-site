# Y.B.S.C Welcome Splash Screen - Audio Instructions

## Audio File Required

   - Frequency: 40-60Hz
   - Heavy, punchy kick

   - Sharp, high-frequency metallic clang
   - Reverb tail

3. **Second Metallic Hit** (0.7s - 0.9s)
   - Similar to first but slightly different pitch
   - Creates rhythmic pattern

4. **Analog Glitch Tail** (1.0s - 1.8s)
   - Distorted, degrading audio texture
   - Fades out gradually
   - Adds gritty, industrial character

### Production Notes

- **Mix**: High contrast, gritty, cinematic
- **Processing**: Analog warmth with digital glitch artifacts
- **Dynamics**: Heavily compressed for impact
- **Stereo**: Wide stereo field for immersion

### Alternative: Placeholder Audio

If you don't have the audio file yet, the splash screen will still work visually. The audio playback will fail silently and log to console.

To create a quick placeholder:
1. Use any audio editing software (Audacity, Ableton, etc.)
2. Layer: kick drum + 2 metallic hits + noise tail
3. Export as MP3, place in `public/assets/jfr_thud.mp3`

### Timing Synchronization

The audio plays exactly when the red dot begins expanding, creating perfect audio-visual sync for the "system engaged" moment.
